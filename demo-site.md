# Weather station demo website

This tutorial will show you how to create a simple website, showing graphs of the Raspberry Pi weather station data.

## Get the data logging code

1. You'll need root access on the Raspberry Pi. From the command line, type:

    `sudo -s`

1. Navigate to the web folder:

    `cd /var/www`

1. Download the files to a folder named `demo`:

    `git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/weather-station-www.git demo`
  
1. Download and unzip the [flot](http://www.flotcharts.org/) JavaScript plotting library:

    `cd demo/js`

    `wget http://www.flotcharts.org/downloads/flot-0.8.3.zip`

    `unzip flot-0.8.3.zip`


1. Return to the demo site root:

    `cd ..`

You should now be in `/var/www/html/demo`.

## Set up and connect
  
1. Update the the PHP script with the MySQL password that you chose when installing the database:

    `nano data.php`
  
    Find the line: `$con=mysqli_connect("localhost","root","raspberry","weather");`
  
    Update `raspberry` to the password that you chose.
  
    Press `Ctrl O` then `Enter` to save, and `Ctrl X` to quit nano.
  
1. Repeat the previous step for `csv.php`.

1. Find the weather station's IP address:

    `ifconfig`
  
  The IP address will be on the second line just after `inet addr:`.

Enter this IP address into a browser, followed by `/demo`. For example: `http://192.168.0.X/demo`.
  
  A page should load, showing various graphs. Note that wind direction is not shown.
  
  
  You can drag the graph left or right with the left mouse button, or zoom in and out with the mouse wheel.

## Downloading data

If you prefer to work in Microsoft Office (or equivalent), the data can be extracted in CSV form and imported directly. Enter the weather station's IP address into the browser, followed by `/demo/csv.php`. For example: `http://192.168.0.X/demo/csv.php`. Your browser will offer you a CSV file download, which will contain a complete dump of all data in the MySQL database.

It's also possible to specify a date range to select records for inclusion in the CSV file. This is done by specifying a `from` and/or `to` date parameter on the query string.

The date format is: `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"`. Time parameters must be enclosed in double quotes. For example:

  - `http://192.168.0.X/demo/csv.php?from="2014-01-01"`
  - `http://192.168.0.X/demo/csv.php?to="2014-12-31 23:59:59"`
  - `http://192.168.0.X/demo/csv.php?from="2014-01-01"&to="2015-01-01 12:00:00"`

  If you leave out the `from` and `to` parameters (as in the previous step), then it does a complete dump of all data in the MySQL database.
